        <p>This is Photon Jumper a game me and three other students made during our second semester of the Higher certificate course.
           Photon Jumper was a sci-fi 3D platformer that took place in a dystopian future, the player is a recruit trying to become an imperial soldier.
           This game took one month to make and it has 3 fully fuctional levels and a interactable enviroment.
           This project was the most fun and best learning experience I have had so far as a game development student. 
           I was responsible for the overall look of the levels such as the layout and what the level would entail.

        <p> This was a fully rendered room corner of a room that I created from scratch everthing you can see from the chess pieces to the walls and the books on the shelves were made by me.
            The room was also my first ever model that i had created in blender, but it wont be the last.
